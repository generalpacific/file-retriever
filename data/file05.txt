BioLuminate hopes to be able to produce a real-time-measurement instrument that will reduce the need for unnecessary surgery If we are successful the probe will significantly improve women health care and could potentially reduce annual health care costs said Hular With BioLuminate we have taken the multi-sensor NASA concept selected new optical sensor technology and packaged it into a thin needle-sized instrument that can pinpoint whether a tumor in the breast is cancerous or benign said John Marion Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory principle investigator for the Smart Probe The BioLuminate needle offers the potential to improve localization of cancer tissue eliminate removal of tissue and the associated complications and most importantly get more accurate information for diagnosis said Lydia Howell M.D. director of cytology and professor of pathology at UC Davis The information obtained by the needle also has the potential to be useful in predicting how a cancer may behave The needle may be able to not only distinguish benign lumps from cancerous lumps but also to distinguish which cancers are more aggressive so the patient can receive stronger therapies This is an exciting technology that has immediate and future promise to improve the treatment of breast cancer said Laura Esserman M.D. MBA director of the Carol Franc Buck Breast Care Center at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center I also am excited by the possibility that this technology would help us to evaluate the presence of residual disease at the time of surgical excision thereby reducing the need for additional surgery for women who are being treated using breast conservation On Oct 29 and 30 BioLuminate Smart Surgical Probe will be showcased at the Medtech Insight IN3 East Fall 2001 conference in New York City At approximately the same time human testing will begin at UC Davis Medical Center The commercialization of this NASA technology is an outstanding example of applying space research technology to bring health care benefits down to Earth noted Phil Herlth of the Ames Commercial Technology Office
